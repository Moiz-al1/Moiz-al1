- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first website ever created is still online? Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched it in 1991. The site, which explains the basics of the web and how to create web pages, can still be visited at info.cern.ch! It's a fascinating glimpse into the early days of web development!
